\newpage
\section*{Introduction}
Survey paper to get an idea of what/how/why of return oriented programming (ROP)
Will go over some reasons why ROP was used/proposed
How we got to ROP from classic stack smashing attacks
Ways to mitigate ROP attacks
Ways that ROP is changing itself for future use
\section*{History of ROP}
\subsection*{Stack Smashing Mitigation Work Arounds}
Classic stack smashing attack, obligatory Aleph One reference
Write XOR Execute OS mode $W \oplus X$
Jump to existing code that is within libraries
\subsection*{Return to Libc}
Attack that Jump to Libc library to perform actions already existing in library
After performing one library function can jump to other function to get linked execution
\subsection*{Return Oriented Programming}
Generalized form of Return to Libc attack that as described in DoROP
Goal is to make a turing complete version of Return to Libc
\section*{Description of ROP}
SP for next instruction
Small bits of code which end in a type of pop instruction
Gadgets
Gadget creation
Put it all together in turing completeness
\section*{Mitigation Techniques for ROP}
There a number of mitigation tecniques from the hardware upto the software level
\subsection*{Hardware}
Instruction Set randomization
\subsection*{Operating System}
control flow graphs
others from the papers
\subsection*{Code Design}
prevent buffer overflows
\section*{Extensions of ROP}
Automated ROP compilation
Jump Oriented Programming (JOP)
Use ROP/JOP form a program, say Mozilla Firefox, instead of Libc
\section*{Conclusion}
ROP is a robust way to attack a system
It is not easily stoppable and is easily extensible
It is growing even today
